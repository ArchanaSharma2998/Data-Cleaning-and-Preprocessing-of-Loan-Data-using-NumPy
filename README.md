Loan Data Preprocessing:
This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing a loan dataset using NumPy. The goal is to prepare the data for analysis and machine learning tasks.

Key steps involved:
Handling missing values using various imputation techniques.
Converting data types and standardizing values for consistency.
Engineering new features from existing ones.
Transforming categorical variables into numerical representations.
Sorting and saving the preprocessed dataset for future use.

Tools and Technologies:
NumPy
